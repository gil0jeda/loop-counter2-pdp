                              **Problem definition**

ask user for small number 
ask user for a second number 
require whole number for inputs 
ensure second umber is greater than the first 
    
use loop and range functions to print the numbres in between the two numbers

display the sum of the numbers printed 



                          2. ***Analysis of variables & functions***

I used a range funciton to  generate the sequence of the numbers inbetween the inptuts by user 

for num in range(int(number1), int(number2) + 1): (the +1 at the end is so that the ending number is displayed 
    print(num)
if (number1) is 3 and (number2) is 7 the program will print out 

3
4
5
6
7

I used the loop funciton for the program to go down the list of values it was given, if the values given are 1,5
the loop runs through the values (1,5) and each number is assigned to i and printed 

for i in range (1,6):
    print(i)
1
2
3
4
5



                                   3. ***Steps in algorithm***

start with def main()    to define the starting point and keep everything organized 

def inputs()              to get input from user

def processing()        in this case its being used for running a range on the numbers entered like shown up top

def output()          this prints the outputs of the whole process like in this program the counted_numbers and the total sum of these 

def get_pos_num      this validates that a postive number was enterd by user, if not it asks the user for a positive number greater than 0 
                    or if a number is not entered it tells user to only use digits 

                                5. ***Screen snips from testing***



                             6. ***Keep track of any wanted or needed***
